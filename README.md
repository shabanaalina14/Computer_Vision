# Computer_Vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos. It involves techniques to acquire, process, analyze, and understand visual data.

Image Processing: Techniques to enhance or manipulate images, including filtering, resizing, and transforming.

Feature Extraction: Identifying and extracting important features like edges, shapes, and textures from visual data.

Object Detection: Recognizing and locating objects within images or videos using models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN.

Image Classification: Assigning labels to images based on their content using neural networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Applications: Autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, medical imaging, augmented reality, and more.
